Fan Controller
==============

Computer case fan speed controller, which uses a simple "fixed" buck converter for controller fan voltage.

PWM is not ideal for DC brushless fans, especially if you want to get constant data from the speed sensor.  This circuit forms a very simple buck converter by using a high-switching frequency coupled with the standard inductor, capacitor and diode.
